# Impl
- Use UserList and other classes to avoid leaning too much on Python builtins for the runtime.
- Compile arguments in reverse order so they do as expected in variadics, e.g.:
- (print a b) -> a b, not -> b a
# Bugs

- Symbols defined in global scope bind to function parameter names, e.g.
```
(let x 1)
(let foo (lambda (x) ...))
(foo) ; compiles and runs
```
# Frontend
- Parse lambdas with empty lists for either params or body
- Auto-generate handlers for bytecode for Python backend (case stmts, function stubs, etc.)

# Ideation
- Compile error message metadata, e.g. what would be most helpful based on the situation of opcodes and likely errors? For example, shadowing a global ID with a function parameter, and trying to call it.
